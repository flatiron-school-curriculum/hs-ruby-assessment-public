## Ruby Review

![ruby](http://media2.giphy.com/media/12jdalMQkt7iM/200.gif)

Time to test your Ruby skills! **Fork** (really important!) and clone this lab.

Follow the instructions and write your code in `ruby_review.rb`.

Then run `bundle install` in your terminal to install the Gems you need and `rspec --fail-fast` to run the tests to make sure your code is working properly.

Once you get all of your tests passing make sure that the lab is forked onto your own account. 

**Check this by typing `git remote -v` in the terminal - you should see your github username in this remote address.** 

Then push your work onto github with the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "passes tests"
git push
```

Go to github and confirm that the code has been  pushed up (look at the photo below). Then follow the steps after that to open up a pull request, so we can see you fabulous work!
